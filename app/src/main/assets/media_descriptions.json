    "description": "Thyroglobulin (TG) is produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the follicular cells. In the Golgi apparatus, TG is packed in vesicles and released into the colloid via exocytosis.Iodide (I-) is taken up in the follicular cells via the basolateral Na+/I- symporter, which is driven by Na+/K+-ATPase. Iodine diffuses to the apex of the cell and is transported into the colloid via the Pendrin transporter.The enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO) catalyzes the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 and their precursors monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT), which are all attached to the TG molecule stored in the colloid.For the release of thyroid hormones, TG is taken up by the follicular cells via endocytosis. Following fusion with a lysosome, proteolytic enzymes cleave TG to release T3, T4, DIT, and MIT. T3 and T4 are released into the blood (via the MCT8 transporter). Deiodinase removes the iodine from the MIT and DIT; iodine is then re-added to the intracellular I- pool.Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland stimulates the basolateral uptake of iodine, as well as the biosynthesis and release of thyroid hormones."

    "description": "The human genome is present as chromatin in the nucleus. Chromatin contains DNA, which is bound to histones as well as non-histone proteins. Chromatin structure is initially determined by interaction between DNA and histones. DNA winds approx. twice around the nucleosome core particle that consists of eight histones (two histones each of types H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). H1 is located on the nucleosome and binds to linker DNA, which is located between nucleosomes.In the presence of physiological salt conditions, 30 nm fibers are formed by folding of the nucleosome chain to a left-handed helix. Chromatin is further condensed by various proteins such as cohesin and topoisomerases. Chromatin is in its most condensed form in the chromosome during metaphase in mitosis. During each condensation step, the chromatin structure is altered through modifications and protein binding."

    "description": "The lactic acid (Cori) cycle regenerates glucose from lactate. In the muscle, glucose is first broken down to pyruvate (glycolysis) and then to lactate. Lactate is transported to the liver via the bloodstream. Here, it is transformed into pyruvate, from which glucose is regenerated via gluconeogenesis. The glucose is transported back to the muscle to provide energy.In the alanine (Cahill) cycle, amino groups from the breakdown of proteins in skeletal muscle are transported to the liver, bound to alanine. In skeletal muscle, amino acids are degraded into α-ketoacids: the amino group is passed on to α-ketoglutarate, which converts into glutamate. From glutamate, the amino group is transaminated to pyruvate to form alanine. Alanine is then transferred to the liver, where it is deaminated into pyruvate again, passing the amino group to α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate. Finally, glutamate introduces the amino group into the urea cycle in the form of ammonia.To aid tracking of the amino group, the molecules containing them have been shaded in gray."

This reaction is catalyzed by the glutathione peroxidase and results in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and water (H2O). To convert the GSSG back to GSH, the catalyzing enzyme glutathione reductase requires NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen). One possible pathway that yields NADPH for reductive reactions is the pentose phosphate pathway (hexose monophosphate shunt). The enzyme glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase (G6PD) oxidizes glucose-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate and reduces NADP to NADPH.The reduced glutathione is particularly important for protecting RBCs from oxidative damage. In its absence (e.g., due to G6PD deficiency), RBCs become susceptible to oxidative stress, resulting in hemolytic anemia."

Accordingly, the hernial sac is formed by the amniotic membrane and peritoneum, and the umbilical cord lies at the apex of the hernia.Gastroschisis: a developmental defect of the anterior abdominal wall in the paraumbilical region through which intraabdominal contents prolapse. As it is the anterior abdominal wall that fails to develop correctly, there is no outer peritoneal or membranous covering.Congenital umbilical hernia: herniation of intraabdominal contents through a patent umbilical orifice, which typically closes by 2 years of age. The sac of a paraumbilical hernia is the peritoneum.Diastasis recti: an abnormally wide separation of the right and left rectus abdominis muscles. The abdominal fascia are intact. There is therefore no herniation, but a midline bulge is visible on straining (e.g., when trying to sit up)."

(3) Proliferation with subsequent expression of both, CD4 and CD8 molecules on the cell surface (double positivity). The pre-TCR undergoes completion and is now fully functional. It will now be expressed as CD3/TCR-complex on the cell surface. These T-cells start migrating into the corticomedullary junction, at which point epithelial cells initiate interaction with T-cells in order to validate their immune competency. Association between MHC molecules and the TCR-complex is required to pass through. (4a) Specifically, CD4 allows interaction with MHC-II, (4b) while CD8 does so with MHC-I.

    "description": "Immunoglobulins are synthesized by B cells and are composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. V(D)J recombination refers to the random rearrangement of immunoglobulin gene segments that occurs during the maturation of B cells from lymphoid stem cell precursors within the bone marrow. This process ensures the diversity of immunoglobulins expressed on the surface of B cells.Rearrangement of three genetic segments (V: variable; D: diversity; J: joining genes) occurs first on the heavy chain locus of immunoglobulin DNA in the following sequence:– D-J rearrangement: deletion of DNA between the D and J segments, followed by D-J recombination– V-DJ rearrangement: The V gene segment joins the combined D-J segment.Pre-mRNA is transcribed from the rearranged DNA. Introns are spliced from pre-mRNA, resulting in the formation of mature mRNA. Mature mRNA then translates the protein synthesis of immunoglobulin heavy chains.Rearrangement of light chain gene segments occurs later in B cell maturation. Light chain DNA lacks the D segment. The V segment combines with the J segment (V-J rearrangement), which then undergoes transcription, intron splicing, and translation of light chain proteins.Disulfide bonds bind the heavy chains and light chains to form immunoglobulins that are then expressed on the surface of B cells and are referred to as B cell receptors (BCR).Note: This process is antigen-independent (unlike the activation and differentiation phase of B cells into plasma cells, which are both antigen-dependent)."

    "description": "1. The B cell recognizes the antigen with the aid of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the BCR/antigen complex is then internalized. At the same time, the MHC II molecules (produced in the endoplasmic reticulum) are pinched off to form vesicles above the Golgi apparatus (not shown in detail). At this time, the MHC II molecules still possess an additional invariant chain (li chain), which prevents the premature binding of proteins to the molecule. The Golgi apparatus is also responsible for the formation of primary lysosomes, which are essential for later antigen processing.2. After uptake of the BCR/antigen-complex, there are at first several individual compartments (BCR/antigen complex in the endosome, proteases in primary lysosomes, and MHC II molecules in vesicles).3. Merging of the individual compartments to one large lysosome makes antigen processing possible. The lysosomal proteases break down the antigens into small fragments. These are then loaded with MHC II molecules to be presented at the cell surface.4. Interaction between the B cell and the T helper cell (Th cell) activates the B cell. The first signal is the binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) and its coreceptors (CD3, CD4) to the MHC II/antigen complex. The binding of CD40 to the CD40 ligands (CD40L) is the second signal (leading to the release of cytokines, particularly IL-4, which stimulate proliferation of the B cell).5. Stimulation allows the B cell to mature into a plasma cell (PC) that releases antibodies that are specific to the particular antigen that was recognized."

As the disease progresses, the DNA is integrated into the cervical epithelium's DNA. A noninvasive precursor lesion, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), may develop from an HPV infection over months to years, which may ultimately progress to invasive carcinoma.In most cases, complete recovery will occur during the early stages of an HPV infection."

They are also produced in response to vaccination and are a marker of immunity to reinfection.HAV RNA can be detected in stool and serum samples in patients with hepatitis A. This test is not routinely used but can be helpful during outbreaks, as HAV RNA can be detected as early as the first week after infection."

The exact mechanisms and molecules used differ between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.Initiation starts at specific DNA sequences (oris) where the enzyme helicase separates and unwinds the DNA strands (yielding a leading and a lagging strand). This process is bidirectional, resulting in two roughly Y-shaped structures (the replication forks) moving in opposite directions along the DNA (the illustration shows only one direction, i.e., one of the replication forks). Several enzymes (e.g., topoisomerase) and other molecules are required in the process.Elongation takes place simultaneously on both strands and always begins with the synthesis of a short RNA primer. Because DNA strands are antiparallel and a free 3′OH group is needed for adding new deoxynucleotides, DNA synthesis occurs continuously in the leading strand and discontinuously in the lagging strand (where Okazaki fragments are produced as a result). Further steps during elongation include proofreading, removal of primers (and filling of the respective gaps), and joining of newly synthesized DNA fragments.Termination of replication occurs via binding of termination proteins to specific termination sequences on the DNA."

It yields a solubility curve with an initial steep rise with subsequent plateauing (hyperbolic solubility curve).The maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) is indicated by the plateau phase which is achieved at maximum substrate concentrations. KM is defined as the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity equals 50% of Vmax. Generally speaking, Michaelis-Menten kinetics demonstrate that the reaction velocity of an enzymatic reaction with steady enzyme concentrations is primarily dependent on substrate concentrations. This means, that low substrate availability results in a decreased likelihood of a successful enzymatic reaction since diffusion off the enzyme diminishes reaction velocity. However, a surplus of substrate results in negligible diffusion that allows the enzyme to work at maximum speed. Further increase of substrate concentrations would fail to increase reaction velocity since all enzymes are already saturated."

A neuronal cell membrane with a resting potential of approx. -70 mV (teal) depolarizes slowly until it reaches its threshold potential of approx. -50 mV (yellow), at which point it depolarizes abruptly (orange). Depolarization ends with a brief positive polarization of the membrane (overshoot; peak approx. 30 mV; red), after which a rapid repolarization phase begins (green) and the membrane potential becomes negative again. The membrane potential very briefly (for approx. 2 ms) drops below the resting potential (hyperpolarization; approx. -90 mV; blue) before returning to baseline (resting potential; approx. -70 mV; teal).Lower chart: The changes in membrane potential shown above occur due to changes in membrane ionic conductivity, particularly for sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions. At baseline, membrane conductivity for K+ (purple) is far greater than that for Na+ (blue). This changes abruptly during the depolarization phase, as voltage-dependent Na+ channels open. With some delay, membrane conductivity for potassium also increases as voltage-dependent K+ channels open (while Na+ channels begin closing again). This leads to the repolarization and subsequently hyperpolarization of the membrane.(Note that the specific values for membrane potentials differ between cell types and that some cell types do not have a stable resting potential.)"

    "description": "Train-of-four stimulations are done by delivering four successive supramaximal stimuli (at 500 ms intervals) to a peripheral nerve. Those groups of four stimulations are repeatedly delivered to evaluate the resulting pattern of muscular response.Normally, the resulting muscular responses (as measured via electromyography) should be equally strong (both within groups of four consecutive responses and over a succession of consecutive groups of such responses).If nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., rocuronium) are administered, the amplitude of muscular responses decreases within a group of four consecutive responses (that the amplitude of the fourth response is significantly lower than that of the first one of the same group). This phenomenon is also referred to as “fade.”The effects of depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., succinylcholine) are subdivided into two phases: In phase I, the drug binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, inducing a single, persistent depolarization. Electromyographically, each of the individual responses in a group of four will be decreased by the same percentage, and the overall muscular responsiveness between consecutive groups of stimuli steadily decreases over time. If depolarizing neuromuscular agents are administered over a prolonged amount of time or a high dose is given, phase II may occur. In this phase, there is a fade in the muscular response, resembling the phenomenon seen in nondepolarizing agents. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., neostigmine) potentiate the effects of depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs during phase I."

The myosin head is in a low-energy 45° position with ATP bound to it.2.) Cocked state: ATP is hydrolyzed, yielding ADP and phosphate → cocking of myosin head (high-energy 90° position). The myosin binding site remains blocked.3.) Crossbridge state: activation of muscle cell with influx of calcium. Binding of calcium to troponin → tropomyosin is displaced from myosin binding site on actin filament → myosin head binds to actin filament (crossbridge formation).4.) Power stroke: release of the phosphate bound to the myosin head → power stroke of myosin head → myosin head moves along the actin filament. This action results in muscle contraction and/or tension, depending on the situation. Afterward, the myosin head returns to the low-energy 45° position.5.)

    "description": "ADH is essential for the regulation of fluid balance as it stimulates the water reabsorption in the collecting duct system of the kidney. ADH is produced in the hypothalamus, from where it travels to the posterior pituitary, over an axonal transport, and is released when required.ADH secretion is stimulated through an increased blood osmolarity and an increased angiotensin II as well as low blood pressure or low blood volume, whereas it is inhibited through ethanol.If ADH is released in the posterior pituitary, it becomes effective in the kidney by binding to an ADH receptor (V2 receptor) in the collecting duct system, which then leads to a stimulation of adenylate cyclase (= catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP).The increased cAMP level activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates and activates aquaporin 2 with several intermediate steps. Aquaporin 2 exists in vesicles in the cytoplasm – if it is activated, it reaches the luminal cell wall and they merge together. Water can now flow into the cell through the aquaporin 2 channels, which then reaches into the interstitium of the kidney through aquaporin 3 and 4 channels."

    "description": "Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by antigen-specific T cells, unlike all other hypersensitivity reactions, which are antibody-mediated. T helper cells (CD4+ cells; Th cells) mainly act by cytokine-mediated recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of the target cells.T-cell receptors (TCR) present on sensitized CD4+ cells recognize and bind to specific exogenous antigens (e.g., bacteria, viruses). These antigens are bound to the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II), a transmembrane protein present on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, like macrophages. Th cells are divided into two subsets based on the cytokines they produce:- Bacterial and viral infections predominantly activate Th1 cells, which release cytokines that preferentially recruit neutrophils and macrophages (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα). Activated macrophages release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), which aid in the destruction of phagocytosed pathogens.- Helminthic or parasitic infections predominantly activate Th2 cells, which release cytokines that preferentially recruit eosinophils (e.g., IL5). Activated eosinophils release major basic protein (MBP), which aids in the destruction of helminths and signals mast cells to release histamine.Cytokines, ROS, and MBP recruit more inflammatory cells to the site of the reaction and amplify the inflammatory response, which typically becomes evident ∼ 48 hours after antigen-exposure (i.e., delayed hypersensitivity)."

As the laser hits each cell, the light scattered varies in accordance with its size, shape, and intracellular and cell surface molecules. Cells containing the target antigen also have the fluorescent-tagged antibody bound to them, which emits light of a specific wavelength when activated by the laser beam (yellow and blue, in this image).A detector directly opposite the laser beam measures the amount of forward scatter, and detectors placed perpendicular to the laser beam measure side scatter and fluorescence.The collected data can then be plotted as a histogram (yellow graph and blue graph) or a scatter plot (bottom right graph). Histograms measure a single parameter, displaying a large number of events (cells) as a spike. Scatter plots measure two parameters simultaneously, representing each event (cell) as a single point and clustering events with similar fluorescence intensities. In the case illustrated, the gray cells do not possess the target antigens and are marked as events at low fluorescence intensity on both axes in the scatter plot. By contrast, green cells possess two target antigens and are represented as high fluorescence intensity events on both axes."

This process is nearly identical in mitochondria and peroxisomes, except for some minor differences.In peroxisomes, FADH2, which is generated during the first reaction, cannot undergo conversion to FAD through the respiratory chain but has to transfer its electrons onto oxygen. This reaction yields H2O2, which will subsequently be broken down into water and oxygen.Moreover, beta-oxidation in peroxisomes does not allow for complete breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA. Instead, carbon groups may only be cleaved off up to a chain length of at least eight remaining carbon atoms (octanyl-CoA). These fatty acids are then released into the cytosol and transferred to the mitochondria for complete breakdown. Acetyl-CoA generated in peroxisomes is also released into the cytosol to be used as substrate for other reactions, e.g., the mitochondrial citrate cycle."

In this way, the ribosome is transferred to the translocon, a protein complex traversing the ER membrane that subsequently opens like a canal. SRP is released and can be recycled.(5) Translation continues and the protein is directly synthesized in the ER lumen.(6) During translation, the signal sequence is cleaved from the growing protein.

The newly formed MHC class I antigen complex undergoes post-translational modification within the Golgi apparatus and enters the cell surface for presentation to cytotoxic CD8 T-cells.MHC class II antigen presentation: Extracellular proteins are ingested by the antigen-presenting cell and held within the endosome. The protein is degraded into small peptides by the lysosome, which then forms a complex with the MHC class II protein. The new MHC class II antigen complex is transported to the cell surface for presentation with CD4 T-cells."

Replication occurs in two directions (bidirectional). Two identical DNA molecules are formed, each consisting of one template DNA strand (red) and one new partner strand (blue). This process is termed semiconservative replication.In eukaryotes, replication is also bidirectional and semiconservative. However, eukaryotes do not have a circular genome."

Their action is brought about by transposase enzymes.First step: The transposase enzyme binds to inverted repeat sequences (IR) flanking the transposons.Second step: Transposase catalyzes the excision of the transposon sequence from the bacterial genome.Third step: The target insertion site is recognized by transposase enzymes, which also catalyze the re-insertion of the transposon at this site."

Common sites of embolism include the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries (saddle thrombus), within the right and/or left pulmonary artery, and within the lobar, segmental, or subsegmental branch of the pulmonary arteries. The degree of hemodynamic compromise is proportional to the size of the vessel occluded by the pulmonary embolism."

    "description": "Primordial germ cells migrate to the gonads in utero and become oogonia (♀) or spermatogonia (♂).Oogenesis: Within the ovaries, oogonia undergo mitosis in utero to form primary oocytes. After birth, primary oocytes undergo meiosis, which is arrested in prophase I until puberty. Meiosis I resumes shortly before ovulation and the resulting secondary oocyte remains arrested in metaphase II. Meiosis II is only completed shortly after fertilization to form an ootid. Each oogonium results in the formation of one ootid and three degenerating polar bodies during oogenesis. In the absence of fertilization, the secondary oocyte degenerates.Spermatogenesis: Within the testes, spermatogonia remain inactive until puberty. At puberty, spermatogonia undergo mitosis to form primary spermatocytes, which then undergo meiotic division to form four spermatids within a time span of 64 days. Spermatids develop into spermatozoa under the influence of testosterone (spermiogenesis)."

Increasing partial oxygen pressure (pO2) corresponds with a sharp increase in the O2 affinity of myoglobin (red curve). The increase then levels off. In venous blood from peripheral tissue, myoglobin O2 affinity is high. While the oxygen affinity for myoglobin sharply increases at low partial oxygen pressure levels, the hemoglobin curve (green curve) has a sigmoidal shape (s shape). At low partial oxygen pressure levels, the curve increases gradually, whereas it is significantly steeper at higher partial oxygen pressure levels, as in venous blood from peripheral tissue. The hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve then reaches a plateau at higher partial oxygen pressure levels. In arterial blood from the lungs, the partial oxygen pressure level is rather high, which corresponds to a high oxygen affinity in both myoglobin and hemoglobin."

The key mechanism of both effects is the fact that Hb affinity to O2 changes depending on the environment.Bohr effect: The affinity of Hb for O2 decreases as concentrations of CO2 and/or H+ increase. This typically occurs in peripheral tissues and allows O2 to be supplied more easily to the tissue (since O2 is more readily released from Hb).Haldane effect: Deoxygenated Hb has a higher affinity for CO2 than oxygenated Hb. Since deoxygenated Hb is typically present in peripheral tissue (rather than in the lungs, where pO2 is high), uptake of CO2 is facilitated there. CO2 is then transported to the lungs, where it easily dissociates from Hb and is exhaled."

The increased calcium ion concentration within the synaptic cell triggers the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) from vesicles into the synaptic cleft.5. The nicotinic ACh receptors on the chromaffin cells are ligand-gated ion channels. The influx of sodium ions triggers depolarization of the cell, which leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels.6. The increased calcium ion concentration within the chromaffin cell triggers the secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine from the secretory granules into the bloodstream. Approx. 80% of chromaffin cells produce epinephrine, while only 20% produce norepinephrine.7. The predominant serum catecholamine is norepinephrine (80%). This increase in serum norepinephrine occurs because norepinephrine is also secreted as a neurotransmitter by the postganglionic fibers from the sympathetic trunk, while epinephrine is produced almost exclusively by the adrenal gland."

The new bacteriophages lyse the bacterial cell wall and are released to infect other bacteria in the surrounding environment.

As any portion of the bacterial genome may be transferred, in a process known as generalized transduction.Bottom panel: specialized transduction (lysogenic and lytic cycle via temperate phages)Once the bacteriophage has injected its DNA into the bacterium, the viral DNA is incorporated into the bacterial genome at a specific location and remains inactive as a prophage (lysogenic phase). Upon activation (e.g., with heat or UV radiation), the viral DNA replicates, is incorporated into phage capsids, and is released into the surrounding environment through lysing of the host bacterial cell wall (lytic phase). During this process, the bacterial DNA flanking the viral DNA is also incorporated into the viral capsid and transferred to another bacterium, forming a recombinant bacterium.

This conversion occurs through hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphate residue and is catalyzed by nucleotidases.Purine nucleosides are then cleaved into free bases (e.g., hypoxanthine, xanthine, and guanine) by nucleoside phosphorylases.Xanthine is then oxidized to uric acid by xanthine oxidase, the uric acid is partially reabsorbed, and the rest is excreted in the urine."

    "description": "Insulin secretion is stimulated by an increase in blood glucose levels.Glucose enters pancreatic β cells via GLUT2 transporters and is metabolized to generate ATP. Intracellular ATP binds to and blocks ATP-sensitive K+ channels, increasing the intracellular K+ concentration and raising the membrane potential until depolarization occurs. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open in response to depolarization and Ca2+ enters the pancreatic β cells. Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration triggers the fusion of insulin-containing secretory granules to the cell membrane, resulting in exocytosis of insulin into the bloodstream."

Accessory parotid glands are common, are most commonly located anterosuperior to the main parotid gland, and drain into the main parotid duct.The submandibular gland is located in the submandibular triangle and wraps around the posterior free edge of the mylohyoid, which divides the gland into superficial and deep parts. The submandibular duct (Wharton duct) arises from the deep part of the gland and opens into the oral cavity on either side of the lingual frenulum.The sublingual gland is located beneath the tongue, between the mandible and the genioglossus.

Calcium binds to intracellular calmodulin and forms the calcium-calmodulin complex (Ca/CmC), which binds to the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), resulting in its activation. MLCK phosphorylates the light chain of the myosin filaments (under cleavage of ATP). This enables interaction between actin and myosin.Right: A decrease in the intracellular calcium concentration results in a predominance of myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP) activity, which dephosphorylates myosin filament light chains, preventing interaction between actin and myosin. MLCP can also be activated by nitric oxide (NO), cGMP, or protein kinase G (PKG). It can be inhibited by Rho kinase and protein kinase C (PKC)."

(2) In the hepatocytes, copper ions enter the Golgi complex via the Wilson protein (ATP7B). (3) In the Golgi complex, the copper ions bind to apoceruloplasmin, thereby forming ceruloplasmin. (4) Excess copper is excreted into the bile via the Wilson protein. (5) Ceruloplasmin is secreted into plasma and spread throughout the body. (6) A small amount of unbound copper ions passes directly into the blood and is available as free serum copper.Right (Wilson disease):In Wilson disease, the Wilson protein is dysfunctional. Copper ions can neither be taken up by the Golgi complex (3) nor excreted into the bile (4). As a result, copper ions accumulate in the hepatocytes, which leads to hepatic damage. A large amount of excess, unbound copper ions passes directly into the bloodstream (6) raising the free serum copper concentration. This results in copper deposition in other organs."

Asexual propagation produces thousands of daughter cells (merozoites), which are transmitted to the bloodstream via merosomes. Plasmodium Vivax and Ovale are associated with the development of dormant stages (hypnozoites) which persist for several years in hepatocytes and later develop into schizonts.Blood (erythrocytic) stage: Merozoites infect erythrocytes and develop into trophozoites, which then mature into schizonts. Asexual propagation produces merozoites, which are then released into the bloodstream via merosomes. This cycle repeats itself over a course of 48-72 hours causing periodic decay of erythrocytes and the resulting pathognomic spiking fevers of malaria.Mosquito hostIngested gametocytes mature into flagellated microgametes (♂) or macrogametes (♀) within the gastrointestinal tract of the mosquito. The mature sexual forms merge into a mobile zygote, which in turn develops into a sporozoite-containing oocyst. The sporozoites are released, enter the salivary glands, and may eventually be transferred to a new host."

ADP binds to P2Y12 receptors on platelets, inducing a translocation of GpIIb/IIIa receptors to the cell surface. These receptors are promoted by Ca2+ ions.(4) The expression of GpIIb/IIIa receptors allows activated platelets to crosslink with fibrinogen as an intermediary.

This circulating Fe2+ from dietary or other sources (i.e., apoferritin stores in the liver, breakdown of hemoglobin) is then recycled to form new hemoglobin molecules within the medullary and extramedullary sites of hematopoiesis or exported and stored as ferritin within the hepatocytes. Iron metabolism is controlled by the hepcidin protein, which is produced in response to increased levels of plasma iron, inflammation, or the HFE protein, and acts to inhibit iron uptake into the circulation."

The procoagulation pathway ultimately results in the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, which is an integral part of blood clot formation. The procoagulation pathway is physiologically inhibited through two distinct anticoagulation pathways, using either antithrombin III or the APC complex.Antithrombin III inactivates factors IX, X, and thrombin. This process is accelerated in the presence of heparin. Additionally, antithrombin III indirectly increases the activation of plasmin through the action of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), resulting in the degradation of both fibrinogen and fibrin.The APC complex pathway involves the activity of thrombomodulin, a membrane protein expressed on endothelial cells that activates protein C. Activated protein C then binds to protein S to form the APC complex, which inactivates procoagulation factors V and VIII. The procoagulation factor thrombin can also activate protein C, which results in a negative feedback loop on the procoagulation pathway."

These drugs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore do not reduce dopamine production in the brain nor do they have central side-effects.Dopamine precursors (e.g., L-DOPA) are converted by DOPA decarboxylase at the presynaptic neuron resulting in direct dopaminergic effects (especially in D2 receptors).COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone, tolcapone) inhibits central (tolcapone) or peripheral (entacapone) catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) resulting in the reduced metabolization of dopamine, increase in dopamine effects, a decreased demand for L-DOPA, and a longer therapeutic effect with each dose.MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline) reduce the metabolism of central dopamine by inhibiting the monoamine oxidase B enzyme, which normally breaks down dopamine (and catecholamines) in the brain. This results in a prolonged dopamine effect and reduced demand for L-DOPA.Anticholinergic drugs (e.g., benztropine) inhibit excitatory cholinergic neurons, resulting in a proportionately lower concentration of acetylcholine compared to dopamine.NMDA antagonists (e.g., amantadine) act as antagonists at the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which results in a dopaminergic effect."

These very large molecules are enclosed in vesicles, transported to the cell membrane via the Golgi apparatus and secreted via exocytosis in the extracellular space (5). At this stage, the collagen triple helix is further processed: The propeptides at the end of the collagen propeptide chains are split off (6). Next, the formed tropocollagens are cross-linked to fibrils (fibrillogenesis, 7). In the extracellular space, several of these fibrils form collagen fibers (8).Various conditions are the result of defective collagen synthesis. Examples can be found in the overlay."

The operon contains a promoter sequence and an operator sequence that overlaps with the promoter. Depending on the relative levels of lactose and glucose, either the repressor protein binds to the operator (preventing gene transcription) or lactose binds to the repressor protein, which is then inactivated and dissociates from the operator (enabling transcription)."

The activated T cell then activates plasma cells to release anti-tTG, anti-endomysial, and anti-deamidated gliadin antibodies (which all function as diagnostic markers of celiac disease). T cells also differentiate into TH1 cells, which activate cytoplasmic fibroblasts to release matrix proteases.

The curve is sigmoidal (S-shaped), starting with a gradual increase, then rising steeply before plateauing (blue curve).Factors that decrease the affinity of Hb for O2 (e.g., ↑ pCO2) shift the curve to the right (green curve). This increases P50 (the partial pressure of oxygen needed to maintain 50% of Hb saturated). These factors facilitate the release of O2 to the tissues.Factors that increase the affinity of Hb for O2 (e.g., ↓ pCO2) shift the curve to the left (purple curve), with a concomitant decrease in P50.The variation in the binding affinity of Hb for O2 represented by the sigmoidal shape of the curve is clinically significant, since it means that a decrease in pO2 does not lead to a corresponding linear decrease in % HbO2. Instead, HbO2 initially drops very slowly, but with further decrease in pO2 then drops precipitously:(A) A pO2 of 90 mmHg corresponds to an HbO2 saturation of ∼ 97%.(B) A decrease of pO2 to ∼75 mmHg corresponds to a decrease in % HbO2 of only ∼3% (to 94%).(C) A further decrease of pO2 to 50 mmHg corresponds to a further decrease in % HbO2 of ∼ 10% (to 84%)."

Optic chiasm: The two optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, where the nasal fibers of each retina cross over to the contralateral side. The temporal fibers remain uncrossed.4. Optic tracts: Each optic tract carries contralateral nasal fibers and ipsilateral temporal fibers (i.e., the right optic tract carries the nasal fibers of the left eye and the temporal fibers of the right eye). I.e., each optic tract carries the contralateral visual field of each eye.5. Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN): The optic tracts synapse onto the ipsilateral LGN.6. Optic radiation: consists of neurons that carry visual information from the ipsilateral LGN to the ipsilateral primary visual cortex7. Primary visual cortex: The visual pathway terminates at the primary visual cortex, which is located at the posterior aspect of the occipital lobe. It is responsible for the perception of sight. The right visual cortex receives visual information from the right nasal field and the left temporal field of vision, i.e. the left visual field of each eye."

    "description": "An infected human, the definitive host of schistosomes, excretes schistosome eggs in urine or feces (yellow and brown arrow). The eggs hatch in water and release miracidia. These flat, ciliated larva penetrate specific freshwater snails, which then act as intermediate hosts. In the snail, the miracidia develop into sporocysts, which reproduce asexually to form cercaria. Cercaria are then released back in the water. When humans come in contact with contaminated water, cercaria can penetrate the skin and enter the circulation. As they lose their tail, the cercaria develop into schistosomula, which then mature into adult schistosomes in the venous system. At this point, a male and female adult worm mate and migrate to the veins of the target organs (liver, intestine, bladder). The female worm lies folded in the longitudinal cleft (schist) of the male worm and lays eggs, which causes inflammation of the organs. As a result of the inflammation, the eggs can penetrate the wall of the organ and enter the lumen of the intestine or bladder (depending on the species), and they are then eliminated in feces or urine."

PTH activates osteoclasts, which degrade bone, thereby releasing calcium and phosphate.2. In the kidneys, PTH stimulates calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule and decreases phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule.3. PTH increases the expression of 1α-hydroxylase in the kidneys, an enzyme required to synthesize calcitriol. Calcitriol, in turn, stimulates renal and intestinal reabsorption of both calcium and phosphate. In contrast to PTH, calcitriol promotes the mineralization of bone using calcium and phosphate."

In contrast, oncotic pressure, which drives fluid into the capillaries, increases along the length of the capillary due to increasing colloid concentration. Accordingly, at the arteriolar end of the capillary bed, the hydrostatic pressure gradient is usually greater than the oncotic pressure gradient, leading to filtration of fluid out of the capillaries into the interstitium. At the venous end, the hydrostatic pressure gradient is usually smaller than the oncotic pressure gradient, leading to the reabsorption of fluid from the interstitium into the capillaries.Approximately 90% of the filtered volume is reabsorbed into the capillaries and the remaining 10% is absorbed by lymphatic vessels, reentering the vascular system at a later point.Pc: capillary hydrostatic pressure, Pi: interstitial hydrostatic pressure; πc: plasma colloid (oncotic) pressure; πi: interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure"

This leads to reduced T-cell activation and B-cell differentiation, resulting in decreased IgM, IgG, and IgA production.Tacrolimus (FK 506) and pimecrolimus bind to the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) resulting in inhibition of calcineurin, an enzyme necessary for the activation of NFAT. This leads to reduced gene transcription and activation of T cells. Cyclosporine A binds cyclophilin, which also inhibits calcineurin.Glucocorticoids (corticosteroids) directly inhibit intracellular NF-κB, a protein complex responsible for transcription of DNA, cytokine production, and cell survival."

First-line treatment options include NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and colchicine.Purine metabolism: Uric acid concentration can increase due to underexcretion (e.g., in chronic renal insufficiency) or over-production (e.g., in tumor lysis syndrome or high dietary purine intake). Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol) inhibit the purine degradation pathway from hypoxanthine to uric acid. Uricosuric medications (e.g., probenecid) inhibit uric acid reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules, thus increasing renal excretion. Pegloticase (a recombinant uricase) catalyzes the breakdown of uric acid into allantoin, which is more water-soluble and, therefore, more readily excreted renally."

Normally, the pelvis is stabilized by the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles, which prevent a pelvic drop to the opposite side.(3) In the case of muscle insufficiency, the pelvis drops towards the unimpaired, unsupported side (free leg), which is known as the Trendelenburg sign.(4) Tilting of the torso toward the contralateral side compensates for the pelvic drop on the unimpaired side, which is known as Duchenne sign. Because the Duchenne sign may mask the Trendelenburg sign, it is important to always inspect the patient's overall posture."

    "description": "Approx. half of cases of malignant hyperthermia are associated with a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR-1). RyR-1 is located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Physiologically, activated RyR-1 in the skeletal muscle interacts with the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), which results in calcium release from the SR into the sarcoplasm.(1) If a mutation in the RyR-1 is present, certain triggering substances may lead to a pathological stimulation of the receptor, which (2) results in uncontrolled opening and excessive release of calcium from the SR. The contractility of the skeletal muscle increases, which in return increases the metabolism. As the increased oxygen need can no longer be met, the cell's energy supply breaks down and the cell dies.(3) The first-line treatment for malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene, which interacts with RyR1 and prevents the release of calcium from the SR of the skeletal muscle.The mechanism shown here is simplified; research on the pathomechanism of the condition and the exact effect of dantrolene is ongoing."

Larger volumes of blood in the ventricles stretch the cardiac muscle fibers, leading to an increase in the force of contraction. This results in a greater stroke volume (yellow bar), which roughly leads to normalization of the end-systolic volume again (4a ≈ 4).Right diagram (increased afterload): When the heart has to eject its stroke volume against a greater aortic pressure from the same starting point (1 = 1a) on the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) curve (i.e., same stretching of cardiac muscle fibers), the stroke volume can't be ejected entirely (stroke volume drops: yellow bar < red bar). Subsequently, at the end of the first cycle (yellow), an increased end-systolic volume remains within the heart (4 → 4a), which leads to an increased end-diastolic volume (1b). The heart reacts to this increased preload by ejecting a greater stroke volume, just as in the left diagram."

Next, the dimer binds on a hormone-sensitive area of the strand of DNA within a promoter sequence (hormone responsive element, HRE). This bond starts the transcription of the downstream gene and leads to the synthesis of RNA, which is then translated into the corresponding protein in the cytosol."

They have a specific extracellular ligand-binding site and intracellular domains with kinase activity and tyrosine residues. Binding of a ligand (first messenger) to an inactive receptor (1) triggers dimerization of two receptors (2). The two tyrosine kinases, which are now adjacent, autophosphorylate one another's tyrosine residues (3). These now phosphorylated intracellular domains serve as binding sites for effector molecules (second messengers), the activation of which triggers a further signaling cascade (4). To terminate the signal, the activated phosphorylated receptors are endocytosed (5) and are either recycled or degraded into their constituent parts (6).It is important to note that type 2 receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., insulin receptors) can be inactive in the dimerized form."

Those tyrosine residues become binding sites for the SH2 domains of STAT proteins.(4) The bound STAT proteins are activated via phosphorylation.(5) The STAT proteins dimerize and move through the cytosol into the nucleus.(6) In the nucleus, the dimerized STAT proteins function as transcription factors for the genes regulated by JAK/STAT signaling."

    "description": "During translation, the codon on mRNA is recognized by the anticodon on tRNA in the ribosome, resulting in incorporation of the correctly encoded amino acid in the growing polypeptide. For interaction between the codon and the anticodon, the first nucleotide of the anticodon (nucleotide at the 5' end) determines whether it can pair with one, two, or even three different nucleotides at the 3' end of the codon. The third position at the 5' end of the anticodon is termed wobble position, because of the certain degree of flexibility (“wobble”) in base pairing. The nucleotide inosine (I) is usually found at the wobble position."

    "description": "Phospholipase C is a membrane protein that can be activated by the Gq protein or tyrosine kinases. In the activated state, phospholipase C hydrolyzes fatty acids from phospholipid PIP2, a minor component of the cell membrane. This cleavage forms two second-messenger components: IP3 (inositol triphosphate) from the head group of the phospholipid, which occurs as a solute in the cytosol, and DAG (diacylglycerol), which remains anchored to the cell membrane. Since the activation of phospholipase C by a Gq can result in numerous IP3 and DAG molecules, this step is referred to as signal gain. DAG activates protein kinase C, while IP3 binds to IP3 receptors on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which stimulates an influx of calcium ions into the cytosol."

    "title": "Protein elongation",
    "description": "Protein synthesis occurs during elongation: One by one, amino acids are added to form a polypeptide chain. The ribosome (assembled during initiation) reads the mRNA in 5'→3' direction. Each base triplet of the mRNA is translated into an amino acid, which is then added to the C-terminus of the previous amino acid, resulting in a growing chain. The chain's N-terminus (featuring the free amine group) leaves the ribosome first.1. At the start of elongation, a peptidyl-tRNA (yellow) is located at the P-site of the ribosome. An aminoacyl-tRNA (green) that matches the mRNA at the A-site of the ribosome forms a ternary complex with eukaryotic elongation factor 1 (eEF1) and GTP. If the tRNA anticodon is complementary to the mRNA codon, GTP is hydrolyzed and eEF1 and GDP are released. This process provides the energy for aminoacyl-tRNA to bind to the A-site.2. The aminoacyl-tRNA (carrying the amino acid that will be added) is now located at the A-site of the ribosome, the peptidyl-tRNA at the P-site. Next, the peptidyl transferase catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acids at the A- and P-sites. In the process, the growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the aminoacyl-tRNA at the A-site.3. During the next step (translocation), the ribosome moves along the mRNA in the 5'→3' direction (for the length of exactly one triplet). Once again, the energy required is derived from GTP hydrolysis (catalyzed by eEF2). The tRNA that was in the A-site is now in the P-site, and the tRNA that was in the P-site is now in the E-site, where it is released.4. The A-site is now free again and the cycle can be repeated."

Carbamoyl phosphate then enters the urea cycle by reacting with ornithine to form citrulline. Citrulline is transported via the ornithine/citrulline antiporter into the cytosol. In an ATP-dependent reaction, argininosuccinate synthase condenses citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate. Next, argininosuccinate is cleaved into fumarate and arginine, which in turn is cleaved by arginase into urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transported back into the mitochondrion via the ornithine/citrulline antiporter and thus becomes available for reacting with carbamoyl phosphate in a new cycle. Urea is excreted via the kidneys."

Most sympathetic postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine.Exceptions (special variants):- The adrenal medulla is directly innervated by preganglionic sympathetic neurons and releases catecholamines into the circulation, which exert hormonal effects on target tissues and organs.- Sympathetic postganglionic neurons synapsing on eccrine sweat glands release acetylcholine."

Glucocorticoids bind to glucocorticoid receptors (1), resulting in increased transcription of the IκB gene, which codes for the antiinflammatory protein IκB. Indirect regulation thus occurs through IκB-binding of NF-κB (2), preventing its translocation to the nucleus. The glucocorticoid/GR complex can also directly inhibit the action of NF-κB within the nucleus. Both direct and indirect pathways result in decreased production of proinflammatory factors, e.g., IL-1, IL-2, TNFα.– Catecholamine sensitivity: Glucocorticoids potentiate the effects of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine by upregulating their receptors."

    "title": "Baroreceptor and chemoreceptor pathways",
    "description": "Baroreceptors are stretch receptors that are located in the carotid sinuses and in the aortic arch of the aorta. Baroreceptors sense minute blood pressure (BP) changes and send afferent signals to the brain stem (nucleus tractus solitarius) via the vagus nerve from the aortic arch and the glossopharyngeal nerve from the carotid sinus. The brainstem modulates autonomic outflow to alter the heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance to normalize BP (i.e., ↓ BP → sympathetic stimulation → ↑ HR, ↑ peripheral vascular resistance → ↑ BP; ↑ BP → parasympathetic stimulation → ↓ HR and ↓ peripheral vascular resistance → ↓BP). This pathway is known as the baroreflex.A prolonged decrease in BP also stimulates long-term homeostatic mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway (RAAS) and ADH secretion (↑ ADH release → ↓ water excretion by the kidneys → ↑ intravascular volume → ↑ BP).Chemoreceptors detect minute changes in pH and partial pressures of respiratory gases. Peripheral chemoreceptors, located in the carotid body and aortic body, are stimulated by a fall in pH and pO2 or a rise in pCO2, which occurs in hypoxia. Chemoreceptors send afferent signals to the brain stem (dorsal respiratory group) via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, which stimulates the respiratory centers of the brain, resulting in an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. Chemoreceptor stimulation also increases the sympathetic outflow to the heart."

    "title": "Apoptosis",
    "description": "Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that is carried out by a set of intracellular protease enzymes known as caspases, which are activated via two pathways:1. The extrinsic (death receptor) pathway involves the activation of caspases brought about either by the binding of certain ligands to their receptors (e.g., FasL to Fas) or by cytotoxic T cells introducing proteases (e.g., perforin, granzyme B) into cells. The ligand-receptor complex activates initiator caspase 8 and the proteases activate the initiator caspase 10.2. The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway involves the activation of caspases by a wheel-like structure, known as an apoptosome. This pathway is initiated by DNA injury (e.g., radiation, toxins) or the withdrawal of cellular proliferating factors (e.g., IL-2), which activates pro-apoptotic factors (BAX and BAK) and inhibits anti-apoptotic factors (Bcl-2). Pro-apoptotic factors increase mitochondrial membrane permeability, thus releasing cytochrome C, which then binds to APAF-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1), forming an apoptosome that activates the initiator caspase 9.3. Common pathway: The initiator caspases activate the executioner caspases (3,6,7), which then cause nuclear fragmentation and cytoskeletal disintegration, resulting in cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing. These blebs carrying disintegrated cellular material break away from the cell, forming apoptotic bodies that are phagocytosed by macrophages."

The ventral pancreatic bud is an outpouching of the future common bile duct and differentiates into the uncinate process and posterior aspect of the pancreatic head. The rotation of the foregut (blue arrow) connects the two pancreatic buds, with fusion occurring around the 8th week of gestation.In normal development (top right image), the distal portion of the dorsal pancreatic duct fuses with the ventral pancreatic duct to form the main pancreatic duct, while the proximal portion of the dorsal duct either degenerates or persists as the accessory pancreatic duct.In pancreas divisum, a common developmental abnormality, the buds fuse but the ducts fail to do so and continue to drain separately (indicated by dashed red line)."

Researchers begin by selecting patients with the disease (cases) and individuals without the disease (controls). The two groups are then compared with regard to exposure to a risk factor in the past.In prospective cohort studies, participants are divided into an exposed (e.g., to a risk factor) and an unexposed group and then followed over the course of time to determine whether there is a difference in the rate of outcome (disease) between the two groups.Retrospective cohort studies begin after the exposure and outcome of interest have already occurred. Medical records previously collected about the participants are compared to determine whether there was a difference in the rate at which the exposed and unexposed groups developed the outcome of interest in the past.In experimental studies, researchers introduce an intervention and study its effects.Randomized controlled trials aim to determine the possible effect of a specific intervention on a given population. People are randomly allocated into an intervention and control group and monitored over the course of time for outcomes of interest."

Longer exposure to adverse environmental conditions trigger encystation.3. Trophozoites temporarily change into a flagellated form when exposed to adverse environmental conditions. When these conditions persist, the amoeba reverts to the trophozoite and encysted form. 4. The amebae multiplies through promitosis during the trophozoite stage.5. The trophozoites or flagellates enter the nose of a human (definitive) host through contaminated water (e.g., while diving, dipping underwater in a hot tub, or during sinus irrigation) and penetrate the nasal mucosa. Flagellates revert to trophozoite form shortly after entering the nasal cavity.  6. Diagnostic stage: Amebae migrate to the brain via the olfactory nerves, causing primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Trophozoites can be found in brain tissue and CSF, whereas flagellates are occasionally found only in the CSF. Naegleria fowleri does not encyst within a definitive host."

Hyperinsulinemia stimulates androgen production in cells of the ovarian theca interna. Levels of free androgens are further increased by reduced sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production in the liver. Hyperandrogenemia stimulates LH release from the anterior pituitary gland, resulting in a disruption of LH/FSH balance and, consequently, impaired follicle maturation. LH/FSH balance is further impaired by increased GnRH pulsatility in the hypothalamus and the conversion of androgens to estrogen in adipose tissue."

An overview of the most important reaction is shown here.- The first and rate-limiting step of heme synthesis is the condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine within the mitochondria to form δ-Aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA), which is catalyzed by the δ-ALA synthase.- δ-ALA then enters the cytoplasm and condenses with another δ-ALA molecule to form one molecule of porphobilinogen. Eight δ-ALA molecules are required for the synthesis of one heme molecule. Four molecules of porphobilinogen condense to form a linear tetrapyrrole that closes to form a porphyrin ring (uroporphyrinogen III). The porphyrin ring is converted to coproporphyrinogen III and then transported back into the mitochondria.- Decarboxylation of the porphyrin ring results in the formation of a protoporphyrin molecule. Ferrochelatase catalyzes the final step, in which a a ferrous molecule is added to protoporphyrin, which results in the formation of a heme molecule."

Electron transport chain inhibitors (e.g., rotenone, malonate, antimycin A, and certain toxic substances such as cyanide and aspirin in toxic doses) block ATP synthesis by inhibiting the proton gradient.

These hypothalamic hormones then directly influence the release of tropic hormones from the anterior pituitary gland into the peripheral bloodstream. GnRH stimulates the release of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), CRH stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and TRH stimulates thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).LH and FSH act on the ovaries/testes to produce sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone); ACTH stimulates the adrenal gland to produce glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol); and TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (T3 and T4).The hypothalamus also influences the release of nontropic hormones like prolactin and growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Prolactin regulates lactation in the mammary glands; GH is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and in turn stimulates the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in the liver.Hormone secretion is regulated by feedback loops, where the hormones produced by target organs can inhibit the release of their controlling hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary."

    "description": "AVNRT is a tachyarrhythmia caused by a dysfunctional AV node with two electrical pathways, one fast with a long refractory period and one slow with a short refractory period (dual AV nodal physiology). During normal sinus rhythm, the conduction occurs via the fast pathway, and the incoming current from the slow pathway is extinguished (top right image).Typical AVNRT is triggered by an atrial premature beat (APB).(1) An APB arrives at the AV node during the fast pathway's refractory period. The impulse is, therefore, conducted through the slow pathway, which is out of its refractory period.(2) When the impulse reaches the distal junction of the two pathways, the fast pathway has recovered its excitability and the impulse can travel up retrograde.(3) The impulse reaches the atria, leading to an almost simultaneous depolarization of the atria and ventricles. The current reenters the slow pathway.(4) A reentry circuit is created with anterograde conduction across the slow-conducting pathway and retrograde conduction in the fast pathway resulting in sustained tachycardia."

In contrast to the whole-leg scans performed by radiology departments, POCUS protocols typically use only 2 or 3 points of compression along the femoral and popliteal veins.– Preferred probe: linear– Patient positioning: supine; leg rotated laterally at the hip and knee bent ∼ 30º– Compression technique: Holding the probe perpendicular to the skin, apply enough downward pressure to slightly compress the pulsatile artery.– Interpretation: The pressure needed to slightly compress the artery should completely collapse a non-thrombosed vein. A non-collapsible vein is highly suggestive of a DVT. Direct visualization of an intraluminal hyperechoic mass (asterisk) confirms the diagnosis.Three-point protocol steps:1. Locate the CFV and CFA at the branch point of the GSV from the CFV. Compress.2. Move the transducer distally along the CFV, just past the branch point of the FV and DFV, where the FA is superficial to the FV. Compress.3. Reposition the probe behind the knee and locate the PV superficial to the PA.

In certain anatomical variants (e.g., shallow anterior chamber), the chamber angle is already narrow and therefore increases the probability of acute and/or chronic angle-closure, which can lead to damage of the optic nerve (glaucoma)."

This, in turn, activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then acts to phosphorylate (P) multiple enzymes, leading to an increase in glycogenolysis:- PKA activates phosphorylase kinase → activation of glycogen phosphorylase → increased glycogenolysis.- PKA deactivates glycogen synthase, → decreased glycogen synthesis.- PKA activates protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor → inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 → increased glycogen phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase (the latter steps are not shown here)."

This prevents premature joining of small and large subunits. The ternary complex of methionine-loaded initiator tRNA, initiation factor eIF-2, and GTP binds to the small ribosomal subunit and forms the 43S preinitiation complex. The mRNA recognized by eIF-4 binds to the 43S preinitiation complex, resulting in the 48S preinitiation complex. Initiator tRNA recognizes the start codon (usually the first AUG triplet after the 5' cap of mRNA). GTP hydrolysis leads to the release of eIF-2-GDP. The large and small ribosomal subunits merge to form the 80S ribosome, the final initiation complex (eukaryotic ribosome)."

The influx of sodium ions leads to depolarization with subsequent formation of an end-plate potential (EPP).(6) Signal transduction is terminated by cleavage of ACh into acetate and choline. The process is catalyzed by the enzyme cholinesterase.(7) Acetate and choline undergo reuptake into the presynaptic membrane to function as a substrate for the production of new ACh."

The CAC also produces precursors for the biosynthesis of other biologically important molecules.The breakdown of glucose in glycolysis yields pyruvate, which enters the CAC in the form of acetyl-CoA. Fatty and amino acids also enter as acetyl-CoA. The condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate results in the formation of citrate or citric acid, which gives the cycle its name.Each C2 molecule that enters the cycle leads to the production of 10 ATP, three molecules of NADH+H+, and one FADH2. In this way, each C2 molecule is completely oxidized to CO2 and water. The resulting oxaloacetate is recycled."

The tumor originates within the internal acoustic canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. Early symptoms occur due to pressure on the cochlear nerve (unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus) and vestibular nerve (dizziness, unsteady gait, disequilibrium). If the tumor further expands into the cerebellopontine angle, further symptoms arise due to compression of CN V (paresthesia, hypoesthesia, unilateral facial pain), CN VII (unilateral facial weakness), and the cerebellum (ataxia)."

Increasing neurotransmitter release– Mirtazapine increases the release of NE and 5-HT into the synaptic cleft by blocking the presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. It also inhibits postsynaptic 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, reducing some of the side effects of increased serotonergic activity (e.g., nausea, sleep disturbances).2. Decreasing neurotransmitter breakdown– Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors decrease the breakdown of NE and 5-HT.3. Inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters and thereby increasing their concentration within the synaptic cleft– Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block serotonin transporters (SERTs), inhibiting the reuptake of 5-HT.– Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) block SERTs and norepinephrine transporters (NETs), inhibiting the reuptake of 5-HT and NE respectively.– Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of NE by blocking NETs.– Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) block postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors and weakly inhibit the reuptake of 5-HT (by blocking SERTs at higher doses)."

    "description": "In a normal erection, an increase of arterial inflow into the corpora cavernosa's sinusoids makes the penis become rigid. As the pressure builds up, the blood-filled cavernous sinusoids compress venous outflow, maintaining the erection. During detumescence, venous drainage is restored and the erection ends.In low-flow (ischemic) priapism, blood is trapped within the cavernous sinusoids because of impaired venous outflow (e.g., due to medication, autonomic dysfunction, sickle cell disease), leading to a prolonged, painful erection with completely rigid corpora cavernosa. Increasing pressure within the corpora cavernosa then blocks arterial inflow, resulting in penile ischemia and tissue damage.In high-flow (nonischemic) priapism, a fistula between the cavernosal artery and cavernous sinusoids (e.g., due to blunt perineal trauma) leads to unregulated, excessive arterial inflow bypassing the protective, high-resistance helicine arterioles. Typically, the corpora cavernosa are not fully rigid or painful, as the venous outflow is intact and there is no tissue ischemia."

The pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation are not separated from one another, therefore, deoxygenated and oxygenated blood mix.After birth, the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) drops, resulting in blood being shunted to the pulmonary circulation, leading to pulmonary congestion and subsequent heart failure."

Once the needle has been advanced by about 2–3 cm into the interspinous ligament, the stylet is removed and a loss-of-resistance syringe filled with saline is attached.(3) The needle is advanced while applying constant, gentle pressure on the syringe plunger. After passing through the ligamentum flavum and entering the epidural space, a sudden loss of resistance is felt and the saline is more easily injected (3a); at this point, advancement is stopped.(4) The syringe is removed and the epidural catheter is inserted through the needle to its correct depth (puncture depth + 4–6 cm). The tip of the catheter must always be advanced cephalad (4a); therefore, the bevel of the needle must remain facing cephalad.(5) The epidural needle is removed, taking care to maintain the epidural catheter at the correct depth. At this time, aspiration is attempted from the catheter (5a: this should return neither blood nor CSF), and an epidural filter is attached (5b).(6) The puncture site is covered with a transparent dressing and the catheter is secured to the patient's back with adherent dressings.

These fuse with primary lysosomes (enzyme-rich vesicles, which are formed by detachment of the Golgi apparatus) to secondary lysosomes, where lysosomal enzymes start to degrade the ingested material. If complete degradation is possible, the products generated, e.g., glucose, proteins, and lipids, are transported to the cytosol for further use. The lysosome can also fuse again with endosomes or secondary lysosomes. If lysosomal enzymes are unable to degrade the material that has been taken up, these remain in the lysosome and accumulate to form telolysosomes. Telolysosomes are exocytosed by the cell or accumulate in the cytosol of older cells."

The cortex shows endosteal scalloping (examples indicated by arrowheads). The growth plate is closed and the lesion extends to the subarticular bone.Giant cell tumor is one of several bone lesions that can have a bubbly appearance. Most giant cell tumors are eccentrically located, although large lesions may appear central. They are typically located at the ends of the long bones in the region of the closed growth plate. Some giant cell tumors contain aneurysmal bone cyst components."

The recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN) branch off from the vagus nerve; the left RLN loops under the aortic arch, and the right RLN passes beneath the subclavian artery. Both RLNs are vulnerable to injury during thyroid surgery as they ascend to the larynx behind the thyroid gland. Unilateral RLN injury may result in hoarseness, and bilateral RLN injury may cause dyspnea and stridor."

This activates the G protein, causing it to bind a GTP molecule (in place of the GDP molecule bound in its inactive state) and dissociate into an α subunit and a complex of β- and γ-subunits (both the γ subunit and the α subunit remain anchored to the cell membrane, as indicated for the α-subunit by the membrane sections shown with each stage).Both the α-subunit and the β-γ complex can now act on various effector molecules, including both membrane and cytosolic proteins. This signaling cascade is stopped when the α-subunit (which has inherent GTPase activity) hydrolyzes the attached GTP molecule to GDP and recombines with the β-γ complex to form the inactive state of the G protein."

    "description": "A flow-volume loop is most commonly used as a graphical representation of spirometry testing. It plots inspiratory and expiratory flow (y-axis) against lung volume (x-axis) during a maximal forced expiration and a maximal inspiration.A (normal): At the beginning of the test, the patient has inhaled to total lung capacity of approx. 6.25 L (normal adult range: 6–6.5 L), and there is no flow. As the patient forcefully exhales, the flow quickly reaches a peak at approx. 10 L/s (normal adult range: 6–12.5 L/s) and then declines almost linearly until flow is zero at the residual volume of just over 1 L (normal adult range: 1–1.5 L). The patient then takes a full inspiration to return to total lung capacity.B (acute asthma): Expiratory flow is impaired by narrowed airways. Therefore, the peak expiratory flow rate is lower than normal with a slightly concave (scooped) curve toward the residual volume. The residual volume is abnormally elevated, as the narrowed airways have prevented a full expiration.C (emphysema): Expiratory flow is obstructed by the collapse of small airways. Therefore, the peak expiratory flow rate is lower than normal with a concave (scooped) curve toward the residual volume. The residual volume and total lung capacity are abnormally elevated due to the lung's increased compliance, decreased recoil, and air trapping.D (fixed upper airway obstruction): Expiratory and inspiratory flows are flattened and reduced, as they are impeded by the fixed obstruction.E (unilateral mainstem obstruction): The shape of the loop is normal, but peak expiratory and inspiratory flow rates are reduced, as air can only enter the open portion of the lung. The residual volume is greater than normal because air in the obstructed airway cannot be fully exhaled.F (obesity): Expiratory and inspiratory flows and total lung capacity are slightly reduced (compared to diagram A) because of the mechanical limitation of the obese chest wall to expand to full capacity.G (neuromuscular weakness): Respiratory muscle weakness results in reduced expiratory and inspiratory flows, reduced total lung capacity, and increased residual volume.H (fibrosis): Total lung capacity and peak expiratory and inspiratory flows are substantially decreased due to the lung's decreased compliance. Note that due to the enhanced elastic recoil of fibrotic lung parenchyma, expiratory flow is not decreased as greatly as lung volume."

Incomplete fractures are more common in children due to their thicker, stronger periosteum and the greater elasticity of growing bones. Types of incomplete fractures include:Buckle (torus) fracture: A compressive force results in bulging, i.e., buckling of the cortex. More specifically, a buckle fracture is characterized by bulging of only one side of the cortex (the concave side), while a fracture in which the bulge is circumferential is referred to more precisely as a “torus fracture.” However, the terms are frequently used interchangeably.Greenstick fracture: There is discontinuity of the cortex and periosteum on the convex (tension) side of the fracture, but bending occurs only on the concave (compression) side.Bowing fracture: There is angulation but no discontinuity of the cortex or periosteum."

The increased levels of fibrinogen cause rouleaux formation (not shown), which pushes neutrophils towards the venule endothelium.Rolling: Adhesion molecules on neutrophils (e.g., Sialyl-LewisX) and other leukocytes interact with adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (e.g., E-selectin, P-selectin), causing leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface. Chemokines pass through the endothelium and then bind to proteoglycans in the intravascular lumen.Adhesion: In response to cytokines, cellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM) are upregulated on endothelial cells and integrins (e.g., β2-integrin) are upregulated on leukocytes, which bind firmly to endothelial cells via these cell adhesion molecules and integrins.Diapedesis: Leukocytes cross the endothelial wall. Neutrophils release type IV collagenase to dissolve the basement membrane. Neutrophils and endothelial cells express platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), which regulates diapedesis.Migration: Leukocytes, mediated by chemoattractants, move to the site of infection through a process called chemotaxis. Chemoattractants that draw neutrophils to the site of infection include leukotrienes (e.g., LTB4), platelet-activating factor (PAF), chemokines (e.g., IL-8), kallikrein, complement fragments (e.g., C5a), and bacterial products."

    "description": "Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is required as a cofactor for methylation reactions and cannot be produced by the body. The process of vitamin B12 absorption from food is complex.Vitamin B12 is usually absorbed by binding to another food protein (Cbl-Prot). These complexes are cleaved by HCl and pepsin in the stomach. Cobalamin then binds to haptocorrin (HC), which protects it from gastric acid. Once this complex reaches the duodenum, which has a significantly higher pH value, this protective mechanism is no longer required and the cobalamin and haptocorrin complex (Cbl-HC) is cleaved by trypsin. A complex of cobalamin and intrinsic factor (Cbl-IF) forms to prepare cobalamin for absorption. There are cubilin receptors present in the terminal ileum that recognize intrinsic factor and initiate endocytosis of the Cbl-IF complex in enterocytes (intestinal absorptive cells).Cobalamin is cleaved from intrinsic factor in the enterocytes (see box) and transferred to the transport protein transcobalamin II (Tc). Cobalamin is then bound to Tc and enters the bloodstream, at which point it is distributed throughout the body.One of the most important storage sites for cobalamin is the liver, the site of inactive precursor activation."

Cargo proteins are further transported from one cistern to the other and are modified (e.g., glycosylated) during the process (2). At the trans face, vesicles detach and reach the cell membrane, where they fuse together. Through fusion, membrane proteins (3) or secretory proteins (4) are transported to their destination. Other vesicles contain acidic enzymes labeled with mannose-6-phosphate and are detached from the Golgi apparatus by the protein clathrin in order to form primary lysosomes (5)."

The S1 subunit undergoes a hinge-like conformational change to expose the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and binds to the membrane protein ACE2 on host cells.3. Activation of spike protein (S protein priming): The membrane protein TMPRSS2 acts as a protease. S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 cleavage site leads to cleavage of S1 (including the RBD). The fusion peptide of the S2 subunit is exposed in the cleavage of the S2 site.4. The fusion peptide of the S2 subunit is inserted in the host cell membrane.5. Membrane fusion: Conformation change of the S2 subunit (folds together to the side; not depicted here) causes fusion of the viral membrane and host cell membrane.

Maintaining this degree of rotation, the patient is then quickly reclined and their head extended slightly below the end of the examination table (∼ 20 degrees). While holding this position, the examiner observes for 20–30 seconds for nystagmus and inquires regarding vertigo symptoms. The procedure is then repeated with the head rotated in the opposite direction. The test is positive (confirming BPPV) if the maneuver triggers nystagmus and/or vertigo during the observation period.The Dix-Hallpike test with head rotation to the right tests the right posterior semicircular canal and the left anterior semicircular canal (and vice versa).Illustrated here are the movements of the otoconia during the maneuver (black dots and arrows) and the upbeat nystagmus with an ipsiversive torsional component (i.e., the eye beats toward the forehead and the upper pole of the eye beats toward the affected ear), which represents a typical finding in posterior semicircular canal BPPV (present in approx. 95% of all patients with). In posterior canal BPPV, a positive result should only occur when the affected ear is turned towards the floor (unless BPPV is bilateral).In anterior canal BPPV (rare), the nystagmus is downbeat instead (while maintaining the ipsiversive torsional component), and lateralization is less reliable (even in unilateral BPPV, testing either side may elicit nystagmus)."

Actin filaments are anchored by dense bodies and dense bands, which are linked together by intermediate filaments. Myosin filaments of smooth muscle have an antiparallel arrangement, with the upper and lower rows of myosin heads facing different directions. This allows strong traction to be exerted on the actin filaments (direction of tension indicated by the arrows)."

The FHR baseline lies within the normal range (green shading overlay) and exhibits moderate variability (∼ 10 bpm; normal range 6–25 bpm).The lower blue tracing shows maternal uterine contractions (in mm Hg). The black markings above this tracing show fetal movements (blue shading overlay).The two decelerations visible are abrupt, with < 30 s from onset to nadir (red arrow overlay). They moreover vary in their shape and their temporal relation to the uterine contractions (dashed red line overlay). These findings are characteristic of variable decelerations. As the decelerations here occur with < 50 % of uterine contractions over a 20-minute time period, they are termed intermittent variable decelerations."

To open her eyes, the patient must contract the frontalis muscle, resulting in the forehead wrinkles seen in image B. Both eyes deviate outwards (exotropia) and downwards (hypotropia) from the primary gaze position. This occurs due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles, which are the only unaffected extraocular muscles. Mydriasis indicates involvement of the parasympathetic portion of the oculomotor nerve.Ptosis, mydriasis, exotropia, and hypotropia are the classic signs of complete oculomotor palsy. Complete oculomotor palsy is more commonly unilateral than bilateral."

Based on the way in which the filaments intertwine, the sarcomere can be divided into different sections. The anchorage zones of the filaments are termed M lines (for myosin) and Z lines (for actin). The zone containing only actin filaments is termed the I band. The region containing only myosin filaments is termed the H zone. The A band contains the entire length of the myosin filament. A sarcomere is the region between two Z lines, which each sarcomere comprised of ½ I - A - ½ I. The sarcomere is stabilized by several structural proteins. Titin (green) stabilizes the myosin heads between actin filaments. α-Actinin binds the actin filaments of two sarcomeres in the Z lines. The sarcomere is the smallest functional unit of the myofilament in striated muscle. Several aligned sarcomeres are called a myofibril and form the building blocks and functional unit of muscle cells (muscle fiber)."

Increased blood flow in esophageal varices can cause potentially life-threatening variceal hemorrhages.In TIPS, a metallic stent is inserted through the jugular vein to connect a hepatic vein radicle with an intrahepatic branch of the portal vein. TIPS diverts the drainage of blood from the portal to the systemic circulation, bypassing the liver, thus lowering portal pressure and reducing the risk of variceal bleeding. TIPS increases the level of ammonia in the systemic circulation because blood bypasses the liver, increasing the risk of hepatic encephalopathy."

Since this is a rare condition, the clinical features seen here are easily mistaken for benign angiomas, small hematomas, or atypical telangiectasia. Histopathological investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis."

To increase stability and enhance uptake into cells, the mRNA strands are encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles.Within the cell, the mRNA causes transient, local expression of the spike protein, which is then either processed and presented via MHC-I molecules or exocytosed. Exocytosed spike proteins are taken up by phagocytes (especially dendritic cells in the muscle) and presented via MHC-II molecules. Presentation of the spike protein fragments via MHC-I and MHC-II leads to the development of a specific immune response against the spike protein."

This enzyme requires the cofactors tetrahydrobiopterin and dioxide. Tyrosine is then converted to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate by tyrosine aminotransferase. The aromatic ring of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate is cleaved and the product is converted to fumarylacetoacetate by isomerization. Fumarate and acetoacetate are then produced by hydrolytic cleavage. Subsequently, acetoacetate can then be used to form acetoacetyl-CoA."

    "description": "The menstrual cycle consists of two phases: the follicular and the luteal phase. The onset of menses marks the beginning of the follicular phase, which usually lasts 12–14 days but may be variable. The luteal phase begins on the day of ovulation and lasts 14 days.During the follicular phase, FSH and LH stimulate the development of several follicles, one of which develops as the dominant follicle into the Graafian follicle. An LH surge initiates ovulation. As the oocyte reaches the fallopian tube, the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. If no pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum regresses and the progesterone level drops. This drop induces vasospasms in the uterine spiral arteries, ischemia, and sloughing off of the functional endometrial layer, which leads to menstrual bleeding (menstrual phase). During the proliferative phase, the endometrium is built up again in preparation for oocyte implantation during the secretory phase.1: stages of follicle development; 2: hormone levels; 3: phases of the endometrial cycle; 4: development of the endometrium during the cycle"
