An LH surge initiates ovulation. As the oocyte reaches the fallopian tube, the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. If no pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum regresses and the progesterone level drops. This drop induces vasospasms in the uterine spiral arteries, ischemia, and sloughing off of the functional endometrial layer, which leads to menstrual bleeding (menstrual phase).

It plots inspiratory and expiratory flow (y-axis) against lung volume (x-axis) during a maximal forced expiration and a maximal inspiration.</p><p>A (normal): At the beginning of the test, the patient has inhaled to total lung capacity of approx. 6.25 L (normal adult range: 6–6.5 L), and there is no flow. As the patient forcefully exhales, the flow quickly reaches a peak at approx. 10 L/s (normal adult range: 6–12.5 L/s) and then declines almost linearly until flow is zero at the residual volume of just over 1 L (normal adult range: 1–1.5 L). The patient then takes a full inspiration to return to total lung capacity.</p><p>B (acute asthma): Expiratory flow is impaired by narrowed airways. Therefore, the peak expiratory flow rate is lower than normal with a slightly concave (scooped) curve toward the residual volume. The residual volume is abnormally elevated, as the narrowed airways have prevented a full expiration.</p><p>C (emphysema): Expiratory flow is obstructed by the collapse of small airways. Therefore, the peak expiratory flow rate is lower than normal with a concave (scooped) curve toward the residual volume. The residual volume and total lung capacity are abnormally elevated due to the lung's increased compliance, decreased recoil, and air trapping.</p><p>D (fixed upper airway obstruction): Expiratory and inspiratory flows are flattened and reduced, as they are impeded by the fixed obstruction.</p><p>E (unilateral mainstem obstruction): The shape of the loop is normal, but peak expiratory and inspiratory flow rates are reduced, as air can only enter the open portion of the lung. The residual volume is greater than normal because air in the obstructed airway cannot be fully exhaled.</p><p>F (obesity): Expiratory and inspiratory flows and total lung capacity are slightly reduced (compared to diagram A) because of the mechanical limitation of the obese chest wall to expand to full capacity.</p><p>G (neuromuscular weakness): Respiratory muscle weakness results in reduced expiratory and inspiratory flows, reduced total lung capacity, and increased residual volume.</p><p>H (fibrosis): Total lung capacity and peak expiratory and inspiratory flows are substantially decreased due to the lung's decreased compliance. Note that due to the enhanced elastic recoil of fibrotic lung parenchyma, expiratory flow is not decreased as greatly as lung volume.</p>"

Hyperinsulinemia stimulates androgen production in cells of the ovarian theca interna. Levels of free androgens are further increased by reduced sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production in the liver. Hyperandrogenemia stimulates LH release from the anterior pituitary gland, resulting in a disruption of LH/FSH balance and, consequently, impaired follicle maturation. LH/FSH balance is further impaired by increased GnRH pulsatility in the hypothalamus and the conversion of androgens to estrogen in adipose tissue.</p>"

The extrinsic (death receptor) pathway involves the activation of caspases brought about either by the binding of certain ligands to their receptors (e.g., FasL to Fas) or by cytotoxic T cells introducing proteases (e.g., perforin, granzyme B) into cells. The ligand-receptor complex activates initiator caspase 8 and the proteases activate the initiator caspase 10.</p><p>2. The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway involves the activation of caspases by a wheel-like structure, known as an apoptosome. This pathway is initiated by DNA injury (e.g., radiation, toxins) or the withdrawal of cellular proliferating factors (e.g., IL-2), which activates pro-apoptotic factors (BAX and BAK) and inhibits anti-apoptotic factors (Bcl-2). Pro-apoptotic factors increase mitochondrial membrane permeability, thus releasing cytochrome C, which then binds to APAF-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1), forming an apoptosome that activates the initiator caspase 9.</p><p>3. Common pathway: The initiator caspases activate the executioner caspases (3,6,7), which then cause nuclear fragmentation and cytoskeletal disintegration, resulting in cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing. These blebs carrying disintegrated cellular material break away from the cell, forming apoptotic bodies that are phagocytosed by macrophages.</p>"

Glucocorticoids bind to glucocorticoid receptors (1), resulting in increased transcription of the IκB gene, which codes for the antiinflammatory protein IκB. Indirect regulation thus occurs through IκB-binding of NF-κB (2), preventing its translocation to the nucleus. The glucocorticoid/GR complex can also directly inhibit the action of NF-κB within the nucleus. Both direct and indirect pathways result in decreased production of proinflammatory factors, e.g., IL-1, IL-2, TNFα.<br/><br/>– Catecholamine sensitivity: Glucocorticoids potentiate the effects of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine by upregulating their receptors.</p>"

Cercaria are then released back in the water. When humans come in contact with contaminated water, cercaria can penetrate the skin and enter the circulation. As they lose their tail, the cercaria develop into schistosomula, which then mature into adult schistosomes in the venous system. At this point, a male and female adult worm mate and migrate to the veins of the target organs (liver, intestine, bladder). The female worm lies folded in the longitudinal cleft (schist) of the male worm and lays eggs, which causes inflammation of the organs.

    "description": "<p>The ingestion of gliadin, a component of gluten, leads to an immune response in the intestinal epithelium in individuals with celiac disease. Gliadin is deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and then ingested by antigen-presenting cells (APC), which activate T cells via MHC II receptors. The activated T cell then activates plasma cells to release anti-tTG, anti-endomysial, and anti-deamidated gliadin antibodies (which all function as diagnostic markers of celiac disease). T cells also differentiate into TH1 cells, which activate cytoplasmic fibroblasts to release matrix proteases. This leads to the destruction of the intestinal architecture with villus atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and the loss of the brush border.</p>"

The operon contains a promoter sequence and an operator sequence that overlaps with the promoter. Depending on the relative levels of lactose and glucose, either the repressor protein binds to the operator (preventing gene transcription) or lactose binds to the repressor protein, which is then inactivated and dissociates from the operator (enabling transcription).</p>"

This process is bidirectional, resulting in two roughly Y-shaped structures (the replication forks) moving in opposite directions along the DNA (the illustration shows only one direction, i.e., one of the replication forks). Several enzymes (e.g., topoisomerase) and other molecules are required in the process.</p><p>Elongation takes place simultaneously on both strands and always begins with the synthesis of a short RNA primer. Because DNA strands are antiparallel and a free 3′OH group is needed for adding new deoxynucleotides, DNA synthesis occurs continuously in the leading strand and discontinuously in the lagging strand (where Okazaki fragments are produced as a result). Further steps during elongation include proofreading, removal of primers (and filling of the respective gaps), and joining of newly synthesized DNA fragments.</p><p>Termination of replication occurs via binding of termination proteins to specific termination sequences on the DNA.</p>"

This reaction is catalyzed by the glutathione peroxidase and results in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and water (H2O). To convert the GSSG back to GSH, the catalyzing enzyme glutathione reductase requires NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen). One possible pathway that yields NADPH for reductive reactions is the pentose phosphate pathway (hexose monophosphate shunt). The enzyme glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase (G6PD) oxidizes glucose-6-P to 6-phosphogluconate and reduces NADP to NADPH.</p><p>The reduced glutathione is particularly important for protecting RBCs from oxidative damage.
